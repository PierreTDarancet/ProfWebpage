Funded by the Department of Energy, Office of Science and led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_Taylor_(computer_scientist)"> Dr. Valerie Taylor, <a href="https://www.anl.gov/threadwork"> Threadwork</a> is focused on the development of a co-design framework for simulation of plasmonic interconnects.

Our contribution to this program includes modeling of materials with strong terahertz responses,     development of protocols for ultrafast plasmonic switches {% cite haldar2024excitation %}, and integration of materials properties in the simulation framework.

   We introduced a simple linearization protocol that extends the use of optomechanical switching protocols to the case of anharmonic phonons in broken-symmetry materials, and demonstrated its efficiency at high displacement amplitudes. Our formalism and results provide a path for improving optical control in nonlinear phononics. (Highlighted as an Editor Suggestion in Physical Review Materials).
