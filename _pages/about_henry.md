Dr. <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/henry-chan">Henry Chan</a>, then a postdoc supervised by Dr. <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/subramanian-sankaranarayanan">Subramanian Sankaranarayanan</a>, stopped by for a few months to develop an early version of the Argonne operating system for <a href="https://cnm.anl.gov/pages/polybot">autonomous synthesis</a> that would become the Polybot software environment. The system and its robotic counterpart developed in the team of <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/jie-xu">Jie Xu</a> quickly far outgrew whatever Pierre could understand or contribute to, and, eventually took a life of its own --no, the irony of an AI-driven system doing so is not lost on us. Henry joined the group as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Illinois at Chicago and left as an Assistant Scientist at Argonne National Laboratory.
