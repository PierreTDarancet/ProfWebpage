Current Position (2024): Graduate Student, Physics Department, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-palmer-6a8788170/"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin-in"></i> </a> 

Dan was a SULI undergraduate student in the summer of 2020 from the Department of Physics at the University of Notre Dame. His project consisted in interfacing the data environment of the Center for Nanoscale Materials with the much larger <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11837-016-2001-3">Materials Data Facility</a>, through the creation of a workflow enabling data annotation, publication, and remote analysis. After becoming a hdf5 and globus guru, he stayed with us as Research Aide helping scientists at CNM to publish some of the datasets listed below.  Dan left the group for joining the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a Physics graduate student.
