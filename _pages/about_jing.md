Jing’s research interests include developing descriptive models using atomic-scale simulations, machine learning methods, and scientific software development to bridge the knowledge gap between theory and experiments. His primary focus is currently on building a surrogate model to describe electronic transport, Joule heating, atomic diffusion, and heat transport in highly heterogeneous devices at nanometer length scales and nanosecond time scales. 

Before joining Argonne, he developed ground state and excited state descriptions for quantum and spin defects in carbon nanotubes and other low-dimensional materials with Prof. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/sahar-sharifzadeh/">Sahar Sharifzadeh</a> (Boston University) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xuedan-ma-850b961a/">Dr. Xuedan Ma</a> (Argonne). 

His current growth interests include building workflows for high-throughput computation, iterative model training such as active learning, and CPU/GPU performance optimization.
