Prof. <a href="https://physics.uark.edu/directory/index.php?uid=sbarraza">Salvador Barraza-Lopez</a> from the University of Arkansas' Physics department spent a few months of his sabbatical leave with us in 2018. Doing so, he enlightened us about two-dimensional materials with structural degeneracies, a class of systems about which Pierre, according to his immediate entourage, is now "unhealthy" obsessed (counterpoint, they sure are cool systems, they sure are everywhere, and wait until you hear what light does to them... Wait I said!). In any case you should definitely check his <a href="https://wordpressua.uark.edu/sbarraza/">group research</a>, including, but not limited to, the wonderful works done as a CNM user.
