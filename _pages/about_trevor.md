Trevor visited us as an REU undergraduate student from the  Department of Materials Science University of Minnesota, and was co-supervised by Dr. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/qunfei-zhou-746a9241/">Qunfei Zhou</a>). He performed some early modeling, including DFT calculations, of the near-field potentials generated by 2D periodic molecular layer without net dipoles that led us to understand the need for a method beyond multipole expansion.
