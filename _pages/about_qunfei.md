Qunfei's research focused on understanding mixed-dimensional heterojunctions (MDHJs) as part of the Northwestern MRSEC. Among many other contributions, she developed an analytical theory of near-field interactions in molecular layers and Moiré materials with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michele-kotiuga/">Dr. Michele Kotiuga</a>, derived materials descriptors for band offset control in MDHJs, and implemented a variation of the  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/nl072058i"> DFT+Sigma method</a> for MDHJs, as well as a density functional with correct asymptotic behavior for molecules on 2D materials. Qunfei joined the group from a postdoctoral position at the University of Kentucky and left as an Assistant Professor of Physics, University of Kansas.
