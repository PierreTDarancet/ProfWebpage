Jithin is a postdoctoral fellow supervised by Dr. <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/valerie-e-taylor">Valerie Taylor</a>, Dr. <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/maria-k-chan">Maria Chan</a>, and Dr. <a href="https://web.cels.anl.gov/~emconsta/">Emil Constantinescu</a>

A recent applied math Ph.D graduate from Northwestern University, formerly at University of Washington, TIFR-CAM and BITS-Pilani, Jithin likes to work on topics that feature beautiful analytic techniques (contour deformations, asymptotic expansions), insightful numerical methods (spectral methods and low rank representations), clever algorithms and their applications. 

He is always up for discussing anything related to these topics.
