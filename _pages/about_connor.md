Connor was a Metcalf fellow from the University of Chicago. He came to the group to work on the design of artificial lattices comprised of carbon monoxide molecules on a copper surface. The idea was to add chiral elements to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.2c04361">our framework</a>, but things got out of hands: Connor solved the electronic structure of the non-periodic Hamiltonian generated from "The Spectre" tile, following the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10798">discovery in March 2023 of a tile that paves the plane, but only aperiodically</a>. Connor not only implemented a tight-binding code solving this Hamiltonian, he also derived an effective model using projective algebra.

Pierre would like to point out (in particular to daring experimentalists) that the arrangement of CO molecules Connor proposed is fully realizable on hexagonal surfaces like Cu(111).
