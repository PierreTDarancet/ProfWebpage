Dr. Sraddha Agrawal is a postdoctoral appointee in the Nanoscience and Technology division at Argonne National Laboratory. Her research focuses on modeling and optimizing the optomechanical response of nanomaterials under illumination. Currently, she is developing a reinforcement learning-based framework to drive optical phase transitions in broken symmetry materials.

Prior to this, she obtained her PhD in Chemistry from University of Southern California, where she worked on excited state charge carrier dynamics in two-dimensional materials using real-time time-dependent density functional theory, nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, and deep neural networks-based machine learning approaches.
