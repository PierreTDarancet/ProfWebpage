Bukuru was a REU undergraduate student from Pomona College co-supervised by Dr. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/qunfei-zhou-746a9241/">Qunfei Zhou</a> in the summer of 2020. He was selected as a REU+ fellow by Northwestern University and finished his senior thesis in the group. He performed some early DFT calculations of molecular layers like C8BTBT that led to our theory of near-field electrostatics.
