Dr. Anubhab Haldar was a visiting graduate student from Prof. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/sahar-sharifzadeh/">Sahar Sharifzadeh's group</a> in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Boston University. His research focused on understanding the coupled optical and lattice response in materials from first-principles informed phenomenological models. He developed a framework to extract and interpolate the polarizability of broken symmetry materials along their Higgs and Goldstone modes, as well as a new illumination protocols for triggering phase transitions in materials. He also co-developed with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristian-cortes-1803481b/">Dr. Cris Cort√®s</a> a particularly simple model of the polarizability of two-dimensional materials integrated on substrates. 

Upon graduation, Anub took on a Staff Scientist position at Samsung.
