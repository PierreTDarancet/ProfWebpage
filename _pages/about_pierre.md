Pierre Darancet is a scientist in the Theory and Modeling Group at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) in Argonne National Laboratory, which he joined in 2014. His research interests are in understanding electrical, mechanical, optical, and thermal properties of nanoscale interfaces and nanomaterials. His expertise is in atomistic modeling (Density functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, molecular dynamics, tight binding and others), numerical method developments, and the derivation of effective analytical models from those calculations. He has, more recently, made dilettante but earnest forays into the fields of topology, reinforcement learning, and metastability. He is a strong proponent of hyperboles, 18th century French literature (excluding Rousseau of course), obscure sport analogies, and experimentalists realizing his Hamiltonians. 

Pierre grew up in a small town named Tarbes in the beautiful French Pyrenees, where he escaped relatively unscathed from the French-small-town secondary education system while graduating from the local music conservatory in Cello and Chamber music (He won't stop showing his recording of the Rachmaninoff Cello Sonata with the brilliant <a href="http://www.didierrotella.com/index.php/en/"> Didier Rotella</a> if asked about it, so consider yourself warned). He obtained his Engineering degree in <a href="https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/fr/formation/ingenieur/specialites/gp.html">Applied Physics from the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées in Toulouse</a> in 2005, i.e. a few years after realizing his limits as an (1) experimentalist, a (2) manager, and a (3) person eager to listen to authority (in inverse chronological order). After sharing his profound desire to pursue theoretical physics with a professor there after acing a quantum mechanics class, he was told to forfeit any hope to do so as "Physics is a disk, and you a mere radius" --a certainly poetic, possibly accurate, but utterly self-defeating prophecy (see point 3 above). He obtained a second Master degree in Physics with Honors from <a href="https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/">Université Paul Sabatier</a> (also in 2005, and also in Toulouse). 

In a twist of fate that would end up impacting his life more than any grade possibly did, a clerical error in the grad school enrollment sent him to Grenoble for his PhD, where he met <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=bxSCSI8AAAAJ&amp;hl=fr">Didier Mayou</a> and <a href="http://etsf.grenoble.cnrs.fr/people/olevano/">Valerio Olevano</a>. Starting with the two of them in 2005 and for the next 9 years, he kept interacting with extraordinary people and scientists who taught him most of what he knows --and all of what he should know better today. Pierre obtained his PhD in 2008 from the University Joseph Fourier in Grenoble, joined Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the group of <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/jeffrey-neaton">Jeffrey B. Neaton</a> for 4 years, and Columbia University in the groups of <a href="https://www.physics.columbia.edu/content/andrew-j-millis">Andrew J. Millis</a> and <a href="http://www.chrismarianetti.org/">Chris A. Marianetti</a> for 2 years. Pierre's habit of being surrounded by higher achieving individuals continued when he was hired in the Theory and Modeling Group of the CNM, where he has the pleasure to regularly interact with his inspiring theory colleagues <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/stephen-k-gray"> Stephen Gray</a>, <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/maria-k-chan">Maria Chan</a>, and <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/subramanian-sankaranarayanan">Subramanian Sankaranarayanan</a>, fantastic experimentalists including <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/xuedan-ma">Xuedan Ma</a>,  <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/richard-d-schaller">Richard Schaller</a> , <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/nathan-p-guisinger">Nathan Guisinger</a>, and <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/jeffrey-r-guest">Jeff Guest</a>, and brilliant postdoctoral scholars.

It is not lost on him that life's inherent stochasticity only turned into professional luck when meeting individuals willing to pardon the under-preparedness bestowed upon him by his provincial upbringing, including, but not limited to, starting grad school without knowing what a Green's function was, starting a postdoc with a subpar English level, and being hired as a permanent scientist 6 years into his (very necessary) postdoctoral training by an institution not supporting postdocs more than 3 years after their PhD. He is also aware that individuals not belonging to his demographic tend to have much more to face than mere stochasticity, and will do what he can to help and support others with the same benevolence he was shown.
