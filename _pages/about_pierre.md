Pierre Darancet is a scientist in the Theory and Modeling Group at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) in Argonne National Laboratory, which he joined in 2014. His research interests are in understanding electrical, mechanical, optical, and thermal properties of nanoscale interfaces and nanomaterials. He has recently made dilettante but earnest forays into the fields of topology, reinforcement learning, and metastability. He is a strong proponent of hyperboles, 18th century French literature (excluding Rousseau of course), obscure sport analogies, and experimentalists realizing his Hamiltonians. 

Pierre grew up in a small town named Tarbes in the beautiful French Pyrenees, where he managed to both survive the utter futility of the French-small-town secondary education system and graduate from the music conservatory in Cello and Chamber music (He won't stop showing his recording of the Rachmaninoff Cello Sonata with the brilliant <a href="http://www.didierrotella.com/index.php/en/"> Didier Rotella</a> if asked about it, so consider yourself warned). He obtained his Engineering degree in <a href="https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/fr/formation/ingenieur/specialites/gp.html">Applied Physics from the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées in Toulouse</a> in 2005, i.e. a few years after realizing his limits as an (1) experimentalist, a (2) manager, and a (3) stable and non-confrontational individual (in inverse chronological order). After sharing his profound desire to pursue theoretical physics with a professor there, he was as promptly as condescendingly told to forfeit any hope to do so as "Physics is a disk, and you a mere radius" --a certainly poetic, possibly prophetic, but utterly back-firing (see point 3 above) recommendation. He obtained a second Master degree in Physics with Honors from <a href="https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/">Université Paul Sabatier</a> (also in 2005, and also in Toulouse). 

In a twist of fate that would end up impacting his life more than any good grade ever did, a clerical error in the grad school enrollment sent him to Grenoble for his PhD, where he met <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=bxSCSI8AAAAJ&amp;hl=fr">Didier Mayou</a> and <a href="http://etsf.grenoble.cnrs.fr/people/olevano/">Valerio Olevano</a>. Starting with the two of them in 2005 and for the next 9 years, he kept interacting with extraordinary people and scientists who should have known better than employing him. Pierre obtained his PhD in 2008 from the University Joseph Fourier in Grenoble, joined Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the group of <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/jeffrey-neaton">Jeffrey B. Neaton</a> for 4 years and Columbia University in the groups of<a href="https://www.physics.columbia.edu/content/andrew-j-millis">Andrew J. Millis</a> and <a href="http://www.chrismarianetti.org/">Chris A. Marianetti</a> for 2 years (It is not lost on him that Argonne wouldn't employ postdocs for more than 3 years but was eager to hire him as a staff scientist 6 years after his PhD).
