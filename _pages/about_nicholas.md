Nicholas Rivera, then a Graduate student in the Department of Physics of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology spent the practicum of his <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/doe-lab-practicum">DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship</a> with us.

He worked on generalizing our time-dependent coupled Boltzmann transport equations to the case of non-equilibrium steady-states such as the infamous "phonon bottlenecks" occurring in (and ruining the differential conductance of) nanoscale conductors.
