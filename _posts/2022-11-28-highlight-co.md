The great <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/savannah-mitchem-35073713b">Savannah Mitchem</a> recently wrote a news story about our  recently published work  {% cite trainer2022artificial %} on artificial lattices made by carving the potential energy surface of the surface states of copper surfaces with carbon monoxide molecules.

The highlight <a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/scientists-construct-novel-quantum-testbed-one-atom-at-a-time"> can be found here</a>. I link it despite my extreme bitterness at not coming up with the headline "I can’t believe it’s not graphene!".

In other, related news, the work was also selected as a supplementary cover by ACS Nano, leading  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-trainer-800917181">Dan. Trainer</a> to produce the following work of art.
