At Argonne, Sraddha will work on developing an understanding and controlling optomechanical effects in low-symmetry materials using first-principles-informed calculations, reinforcement learning, and machine learning. This work is a close collaboration with the experimental group of <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/schaller/"> Richard Schaller</a> at CNM, and will immensely benefit from the wisdom and guidance of <a href="https://foundry.lbl.gov/about/staff/stephen-whitelam/">Steve Whitelam</a> at the Molecular Foundry and the knowledge of the groups of <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/maria-k-chan">Maria Chan</a> and <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/subramanian-sankaranarayanan">Subramanian Sankaranarayanan</a> in CNM Theory and modeling group.
